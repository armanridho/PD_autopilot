## 🔎 Automated Security Scanning Script

## 📌 Overview

This script automates the process of enumerating subdomains, checking active hosts, scanning for open ports, detecting technologies, finding vulnerabilities, and discovering hidden parameters or endpoints. It integrates various security tools such as Subfinder, Httpx, Naabu, Nuclei, and Katana.

## ⚡ Features

- Subdomain Enumeration (Subfinder)
- Active Host Checking (Httpx)
- Port Scanning (Naabu)
- Technology Detection (Httpx tech-detect)
- Vulnerability Scanning (Nuclei)
- Endpoint & Parameter Discovery (Katana)
- Notification Support (Notify, optional)
